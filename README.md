These are all of my works for a class titled CSCE146, Algorithmic Design 2, at the University of South Carolina, completed in my first semester of my freshman year (Fall 2024).
Each assignment had a certain task we had to complete, as outlined by the professor on his website. A basic rundown of each assignment is listed below, as written by our professor:

Homework00: "Write a program that performs a variety of vector math operations. These operations include adding vectors, subtracting vectors, and finding the magnitude of a vector."
Homework01: "Write a program which replicates the final game of a famous price related game show. In this version, a “Showcase” contains exactly 5 unique randomly selected prizes. The user must guess the sum of the prizes within $1,300 below or equal to the sum in order to win."
Homework02: "Write a program in which the user loads and searches a database of video games. Users should have the option to search games by their title, their console, or both based on partial matches. In addition, the user can use the wildcard “*” to indicate they want all results from either titles or consoles. The user should have the option to both print the results of the search via the console or print the results to a file."
Homework03: "Write a program in which the user can manage a collection of tasks. Each task has an associated action a priority. The tasks must be organized into a collection of different lists based on their priority value, where the highest priority is 0 and the lowest is 4."
Homework04: "Write a program that simulates a robot running a queue of commands to move around a board with obstacles."
Homework05: "Write a program in which it draws a triangular fractal called Sierpinski’s Triangle using recursion and Java Swing."
Homework06: "Write a program which will generate a sheep shearing schedule based on a given file and priority scheduling. Only one sheep can be sheared at a time and the other sheep must wait to be sheared. While the other sheep are waiting, they are prioritized by smaller shearing times and then by their name in alphabetical order. The next sheep to be sheared has the highest priority."

Lab00: "Implement bubble sort for an array of integers by following the instructions."
Lab01: "Write a program that analyzes a collection of words and sorts them in ascending order by the number of vowels, consonants, and the length of the word."
Lab02: "Write a solution that performs file input and output (File I/O) using a variety of file types and problems."
Lab03: "Implement a system that keeps tracks of groceries in a singly linked-list."
Lab04: "Write a doubly linked list of type double.  This link list is similar to the singly linked list except that each node in addition to having data and a next link it now has a previous link."
Lab05: "Write a program which simulates first come first serve process scheduling using a queue."
Lab06: "I really like the word SORT! SORT SORT SORT SORT!  All SORTS of SORTS! Anyways, I like it so much that I want you to write a program to analyze some strings inputted from the user, count the number of times SORT (case doesn’t matter) appears in each string, then sort them from least number of SORT’s to most number of SORT’s!"
Lab07: "Write a program which creates a binary search tree of different fruit from a file."

I achieved a grade of 100% on each of the 7 homework assignments.
I achieved a grade of 100% on each of the 8 lab solutions that I completed.
Each of the lab reports had scattered results, but I passed all of them, as well.
There was an additional lab that I did not complete, however it did not change my course grade, which was an A.
